3.0.2

CORE      - Fix a crash that was triggering on windows builds




3.0.1

Software rebrands to Munt name.
This build represents our final switch from Qt to Electron for UI builds, Qt is completely removed from the codebase, users who require Qt specific functionality should remain on 2.5.0 until the 3.x series matures and gains more features

UI        - New electron based UI
CORE      - Switch to guix for macOS builds as well; all official builds now done on guix
CORE      - Update various library dependencies to latest versions
NET       - Bump MIN_PEER_PROTO_VERSION to 70020; This will disconnect from network all peers not on 2.5.0 or above
UI        - Native M1/arm64 builds for macOS




2.5.0

Introduce reward changes
    
At block 1'619'997 chain forks and per block dev reward is removed, with a once off dev payment of 100'000'000 NLG paid into address GSTG9pQ6yRdGurmjUDGwm8FyYc272vP13b
    
To keep the eventual supply at exactly 700'000'000 other small changes are then made:
    * First halving is brought forward to block 2'074'989
    * We slightly alter the rounding of each halving step to give cleaner numbers
    * We continue halving for more rounds all the way down to 0.00000001 reward
    * Final reward amount continues until block 433'009'989 with the 12.2709 NLG for this period being slowly paid out over a very very long period

Halving schedule as follows (every four years):
    5 mining,          7.5 witness
    2 mining,          4 witness
    1 mining,          2 witness
    0.5 mining,        1 witness
    0.2 mining,        0.5 witness

    0.000005 mining,   0.00001 witness
    0.000002 mining,   0.000005 witness
    0.000001 mining,   0.000002 witness
    0.0000005 mining,  0.000001 witness
    0.0000002 mining,  0.0000005 witness
    0.0000001 mining,  0.0000002 witness

            Reward changes to take place at block 1'400'000
            Halvings every 842'500 blocks, this is roughly four years assuming stable block times (a tiny fraction over in order to make things work out smoothly)
            Very minor truncation based rounding applied when halving in order to keep numbers clean and end on a clean supply amount
            Final supply of 700'000'000 with last reward mined on block 17'727'500

CONSENSUS - Enable spending of addresses with uncompressed keys again
CONSENSUS - Allow renewal of multiple parts of the same witness account in a single transaction instead of requiring a renewal for each part
CORE/UI   - Introduce a separate mining parameter for number of threads to use for "arena setup" when mining so that this can be set independently of "mining threads"
CORE      - Fix a sync issue that would sometimes cause new installs to get stuck when syncing the first few blocks 
CORE      - Apply some optimisations to ConnectBlock calls that should improve performance quite substantially on some machines

CORE    - Fix a bug that was preventing witnesses from taking advantage of the ability to add transactions to the block they witness
          This should lead to smoother transaction verification (lower average time until first confirm) and also allow witnesses to earn a small amount extra through transaction rewards
CMDFLAG - Implement blockmaxsize flag for witness block creation as well, previously was only for mining block creation

CORE    - Remove various phase3 related parts of the codebase, these removals improve application performance and simplify the codebase
CORE    - Remove old official testnet and start a new improved testnet in its place
CORE    - Introduce "genesis witness" concept for testnet, that allows accelerated testnets to start with witnessing/phase5 already active from block 0
CORE    - Introduce various unity/node.js/electron related changes to the codebase, that will allow for electron UI to be adopted in future. Electron UI already in relatively advanced stages but needs further work before merge

NB! (Only relevant for old phase3 accounts, does not apply to phase4 accounts)
With the removal of special purpose phase3 code this release introduces some potential oddities to transaction lists for accounts that locked/unlocked funds to a phase 3 witness, instead of showing as a lock/unlock these actions will show as sending/receiving external funds.
Witness generation actions of old phase 3 accounts will still show correctly.
This will be cleaned up as part of the ongoing work on a new UI, and will show correctly again in future.




2.2.0.7

NET     - Improve networking performance
NET     - Remove support for old protocol versions that are no longer supported
RPC     - Fix a crash in gettxoutsetinfo; Improve gettxoutsetinfo behaviour for new transaction output types

UI      - Fix a balance display issue some wallets were experiencing
CORE    - Fix a rare crash that was being triggered in some nodes

CORE    - Improve mining behaviour for v2 transactions, insert an extra nonce, this is unlikely to matter at current mining speeds in any way but is better for correctness anyway. (Only really relevant in fringe cases like mining with -limitdeltadiffdrop=0)




2.2.0.4

UI      - Fix display of witness locktime end date
UI      - Improve phase4 witness renewal so that multi-part witness accounts can renew all parts in one go

UI      - Minor fixes to witness dialog
CORE    - Minor stability fixes




2.2.0.1

UI      - Minor cosmetic fixes
CORE    - Minor stability fixes




2.2.0.0

This release incorporates several major feature branches, which combined involve over years of major development effort.
Highlights include:
 * The final phase of our PoW² rollout, which brings new functionality to witness addresses/accounts
 * Our new 'v2' transaction format
 * Unity; A single unified codebase backend that is shared between desktop and mobile wallets

PoW² phase4:
CORE    - Ability to compound witness earnings becomes active
CORE    - Delta difficulty adjustments now uses the more accurate witness time instead of the mining time, which should improve block timings and reduce  hash rate swings
UI      - Easily toggle compounding on/off for a witness account
UI      - Extend the locktime and/or quantity of a witness account via UI
UI      - New optimise button which can be used on large witness accounts (>1% network weight) to divide/combine into smaller/larger parts for better earnings
UI      - Improved dialog for funding witness accounts; Also automatically optimizes large witness accounts (>1% network weight) into multiple parts when creating if appropriate
RPC     - Various Phase4 RPC commands become active:
            Add funds to a witness account and/or extend the lock period - extendwitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account" "amount" "time" 
            Add funds to a witness address and/or extend the lock period - extendwitnessaddress "funding_account" "witness_address" "amount" "time" 
            Split a witness account into multiple witness addresses; Lock period is not changed this exists for the benefit of users whose weight is too large for the network - splitwitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account" "amounts" 
            Merge multiple identical witness addresses into a single one; Only works on identical accounts i.e. ones that have previously been split - mergewitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account"
            Change the witness key on an account where the key may have been compromised or as a periodic precaution - rotatewitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account" 
            Change the witness key on an address where the key may have been compromised or as a periodic precaution  - rotatewitnessaddress "funding_account" "witness_address" 
            Set a witness account to compound all or part of the earnings it receives - setwitnesscompound "witness_account" "amount"
            Check the compounding settings for a witness account - getwitnesscompound "witness_account"
            Set an address or script other than the default for witness reward payout - setwitnessrewardscript "witness_account" "destination" force_pubkey
            Get the current address or script that has been set for witness reward payout - getwitnessrewardscript "witness_account" 
            Set the compounding template for a witness account; Can be used to managed advanced configurations of how the reward should be paid out - setwitnessrewardtemplate "witness_account" [["destination1" (,"amount") (,"percentage%") (,"remainder") (,"compound_overflow")], ["destination2" ...], ...]
            Get the compounding template for a witness account - getwitnessrewardtemplate "witness_account" 


v2 transaction format (SegSig):
CORE    - New compact transaction format, with a "only pay for what you use" philosophy. Extensible transaction output/input types and flags for easier future extendability in various directions. Uses various built in methods like compact amount representation to ensure transactions are as small as possible while being efficient to process.
CORE    - Transaction functionality like RBF using proper built in flags instead of magic values
CORE    - Three new initial transaction types (extensible to more)
            * Script - Bitcoin compatible 'script' format as in v1 transaction format, for more complex types of transactions that require this functionality 
            * StandardKeyHash - A compact and concise format for regular day to day transactions without the extra unnecessary processing overhead of a scripting language
            * PoW2WitnessOutput - A compact and concise format for witness transactions; Replaces the sub-optimal requirement of placing all the witnessing information in; More compact, faster to process and leads to a cleaner code base
CORE    - Compact transaction signatures used throghout for smaller transaction size
CORE    - Introduce 'index based outpoints' to new transaction format; allowing for reduction of transaction size in many cases.
CORE    - Remove unncessary requirement of 'OP_0' from multisig transaction signatures (Legacy bitcoin bug)
CORE    - Transaction signatures are seperate from the transaction script; Similar to SegWit, but done in a more efficient way that doesn't have to worry about backwards compatibility
CORE    - Remove sources of transaction malleability; Similar to SegWit, but done in a more efficient way that doesn't have to worry about backwards compatibility 


Other:
CORE    - Extend recovery phrase with (optional) birth number
UI      - Option to hide status bar when synchronized (default enabled). Disable to always show status indicators.
RPC     - Implement new 'importlinkedaccount' command.
RPC     - Add an optional purge option to 'deleteseed' command.

2.0.0

This release incorporates three new major feature branches, which combined involve over a year of intense development effort:
* PoW² - See https://github.com/Gulden/gulden-official/raw/master/technical_documentation/Gulden_PoW2.pdf for technical information
Highlights include: Ability to lock funds for a period of time and earn rewards while securing the network. Drastically enhanced network security.

UI  - New "witness overview" dialog with info and statistics on witness accounts, complete with a graph showing current and predicted earnings.
UI  - New "witness fund" dialog, with estimate to help pick the right weight when funding an account.
CORE - New blockchain consensus rules for a PoW² driven blockchain with determistic witnessing.
CORE - New address type for two key witness accounts
CORE - New account types for witnessing, including special behaviour (hardening) of the witness key chain so that witness keys can be shared without compromising wallet security.
CORE - New witness-only account types for linked witnessing between main wallet and a backup witness device.
CORE - Automatic witnessing of incoming blocks in exchange for rewards
RPC - New commands:
View a statistical/informational snapshot of the witness system for any block in the blockchain - getwitnessinfo "block_specifier" verbose mine_only
Create a new witness account - createwitnessaccount "name"
Lock funds into a witness account - fundwitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account" "amount" "time" "force_multiple"
Add funds to a witness account and/or extend the lock period - extendwitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account" "amount" "time" 
Add funds to a witness address and/or extend the lock period - extendwitnessaddress "funding_account" "witness_address" "amount" "time" 
Export a URL for creation of a linked "witness-only" account - getwitnessaccountkeys "witness_account" 
Import a "witness-only" account from a URL that has previously been exported - importwitnesskeys "account_name" "encoded_key_url" "create_account"
Split a witness account into multiple witness addresses; Lock period is not changed this exists for the benefit of users whose weight is too large for the network - splitwitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account" "amounts"
Merge multiple identical witness addresses into a single one; Only works on identical accounts i.e. ones that have previously been split - mergewitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account"
Renew a witness account that has expired due to failiure to witness - renewwitnessaccount "witness_account" 
Change the witness key on an account where the key may have been compromised or as a periodic precaution - rotatewitnessaccount "funding_account" "witness_account"
Change the witness key on an account where the key may have been compromised or as a periodic precaution  - rotatewitnessaddress "funding_account" "witness_address"
Set a witness account to compound all or part of the earnings it receives (phase 4 only) - setwitnesscompound "witness_account" "amount"
Check the compounding settings for a witness account - getwitnesscompound "witness_account"
Set an address or script other than the default for witness reward payout - setwitnessrewardscript "witness_account" "address_or_script" force_pubkey 
Get the current address or script that has been set for witness reward payout - getwitnessrewardscript "witness_account" 
RPC - GetBlockTemplate support for mining in conjunction with phase 3 witnessing.


* SegSig - A new transaction format. See https://github.com/Gulden/gulden-official/blob/master/technical_documentation/transaction_format.md for technical information.
Highlights include: Solving of malleability issues; More compact transactions (over 50% in some cases) leading to increased network capacity for peak transaction periods; New transaction types (for PoW²); Extensible transaction types for future development.

CORE - Implement fixes for transaction malleability
CORE - Implement new more compact transaction format
CORE - Implement two new transaction types "StandardKeyHash" and "PoW2_Witness"
CORE - Implement version scheme allowing easy future creation of additional compact special purpose transactions
CORE - Witness based version bit activation, for better control of future updates. Feature activation can now be controlled by "miner voting", "witness voting" or a combination at developer discretion.


* Sonic - The sonic project involves multiple changes to the p2p networking stack within Gulden.
Highlights include: A switch to boost::asio for the networking stack to replace the old select() based networking code; Multiple improvements to the initial chain synchronisation process, including reverse header synchronisation, making it drastically faster; Removal of limitations to how many peers a server can handle, which helps solve scalability/congestion issues on the network in peak usage periods.


* Non exhaustive list of additional general changes.
UI - Gulden desktop client gains an automatic update check to alert users of updates. Update check is cryptographically secured to ensure that it cannot be tampered with.
UI - Improved handling of wallet alerts/warnings through a new warning dialog.

CMDFLAG - Add a -windowtitle command flag, primarily intended to be used to assist with testing so that multiple program instances can be easily distinguished.
CMDFLAG - Add a new -disableui flag to start with just a RPC console (and wallet); Useful for some types of debugging.
RPC - New command 'getaccountbalances' return a list of individual balances for all accounts.
RPC - New command 'listunspentforaccount' as account specific counterpart for listunspent.
